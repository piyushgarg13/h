     <p>North and South India are both great travel destinations. Deciding on which to visit for your first trip will depend on your travel style and expectations. So which choice is best for you? The bustling cultural regions of the north or the relaxed lush valleys of the south?

        For those wanting a sensory overload and culturally rich experience we would recommend the north. For travellers wanting a relaxing atmosphere and who might be a little worried about culture shock, we recommend the south.
        
        In this article we will share our experiences of both north and south India and provide helpful information so that you can make the best decision for you based on your travel interests.</p>
