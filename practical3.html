    <p>he first case of coronavirus was reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan city of China as a pneumonia outbreak. Later, its root was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus. The outbreak of coronavirus infection soon spread to other provinces of the country, forcing the govt to lockdown dozen of cities with millions of people. Within weeks, the coronavirus spread outside of the country to other nations like South Korea, Iran, Italy, United States, India, Pakistan among others. Countries around the world have taken strict decisions to close the entry of foreigners, schools, colleges, gyms, clubs, cinema halls, malls and other public places to stop the spread of Covid-19. The Covid-19 positive cases in India had started to drop significantly from September 2020, however, it started rising again under a second wave from March 2021.The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic in India is proving to be more devastating than the first. The biggest worry is that 80-85% of the population in India are asymptomatic and continue to be the largest carrier of the coronavirus. As of April 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed Covid-19 positive cases in the world (after the United States) with more than 17 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and 192,311 deaths </p>
